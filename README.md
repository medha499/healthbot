# ðŸ§  HealthBot AI Pro: Advanced clinical intelligence â€” governed, real-time access to EHR data with retrieval-augmented reasoning, accelerating processing time for rapid action.


--- 
## What it does 

* Patient look-up & summarization: Pulls structured data (problems, meds, labs, encounters) and generates an interpretable summary with citations back to source records.

* Conversational Q&A (RAG): Answers clinician/repsâ€™ questions using LangGraph orchestration over Redshift + vector index, with guideline snippets when relevant.

* Proactive literacy tools: Adaptive quizzes/explanations for patients or reps, improving comprehension and reducing re-asks.

* Governance & auditability: Standardized outputs, lineage to original EHR fields, session logs, and KPI dashboards.
