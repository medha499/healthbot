Overview

HealthBot AI Pro is a clinical intelligence platform designed to simplify and accelerate access to Electronic Health Records (EHR) for healthcare professionals. Built with Streamlit, AWS S3, Redshift, Python, and LangChain, the system integrates raw healthcare data ingestion, patient record lookup, and retrieval-augmented conversational intelligence to provide fast, reliable, and interpretable insights.

Features

* Patient Medical Record Lookup
Query patient records in real time via unique patient IDs with a clean and intuitive Streamlit UI.

* EHR Data Pipeline

Parsed and normalized 50K+ JSON event records into Redshift through Python + S3 ingestion pipelines.

Optimized schema and ETL logic for sub-second interactive queries on complex healthcare datasets.

* Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence

Implemented retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines with monitoring hooks.

Achieved 30% improvement in accuracy and 40% reduction in latency during conversational querying.

* Reliability & Monitoring

Conducted reinforcement-tuned experiments to improve reliability of responses.

Enhanced failure detection and fallback handling, ensuring safe and auditable AI outputs for clinical contexts.
